1. I am feeling confident with Arrays, the ability to access elements and add or remove elements seems to be straightforward.
2. I just think I need to practice the methods a little bit more to get some muscle memory for what they do.
3. I am curious to see how Arrays fit into the bigger picture, and how to combine and manipulate arrays more than what we have tried so far.
